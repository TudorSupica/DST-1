Maybe the most popular distortion pedal to ever hit the market. It's harsh attack and heavy distortion make it the perfect choice for genres like thrash and heavy metal.

# The DST-1
![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc7f2a9-1604-4bfc-8b5a-85f73fa79db2)
The DST-1 is a copy of the DS-1's schematic, but modified in certain ways.
The original DS-1 used some relatively hard to find components, so i've swapped those out with some common components like the 2N3904 and the TL072.

# The PCB
I've yet to test the circuit, but the PCB is on it's way and will soonly arrive.

To do:
- [x] Schematic
- [x] PCB design
- [ ] Integrate the pedal in an enclosure
